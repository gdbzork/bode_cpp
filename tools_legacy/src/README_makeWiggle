Basic syntax:

makeWiggle [options] input.bed output_prefix

where output_prefix is the prefix of the output filename.  For example, if you want the result to
be named "zork.wig", you would use "zork" as the output_prefix.

Options:

-b -- file is in Bed format (default)
-g -- file is GFF
-m -- file is in MAQ format
-o -- file is in Bowtie format
-s -- file is Exonerate's "sugar" output format
-c -- input file is compressed
-1 -- output file should be one file (normally it splits the output into multiple files for
      easier uploading to UCSC)
-t nn -- threshold below which to discard points (e.g. -t 2 means don't show positions which
         are one unit high
-i nn -- interval at which to draw a line (default 10, probably want 1 if it's input to another
         program
-r nn -- how many lines to put in each file, if -1 is not specified 
-n xxx -- name to use as track header in wiggle file (defaults to filename)
-d xxx -- description in track header file (defaults to filename)
-a xxx -- write wiggle file in form suitable for IGB (no longer needed)
-B -- generate Bedgraph instead of Wiggle
-q nn -- filter out reads with score less than nn
-N nn -- normalize to nn reads (if you want to compare 2 wiggle files with different numbers of
         reads
